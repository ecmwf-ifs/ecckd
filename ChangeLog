version 1.2
	- Added "fine" and "window" shortwave band structures for
	reference calculations including high resolution 290-340 nm for UV
	index calculations
	- create_look_up_table stores the min and max molar absorption
	coefficients, which can be used by optimize_lut to set hard bounds
	on the optimized coefficients and also to set the prior errors

version 1.1
	- Made use of Adept L-BFGS minimizer the default
	- Removed lbfgs library

version 1.0 (January 2022)
	- Improved optimization of relative-linear representations (CH4
	and N2O), included optimization of CFC11
	- LW scripts produce models with g-point counts divisible by 4
	- Fixed bug in find_g_points shortwave where SSI was used
	without having been reordered
	- Introduced use of sub-bands for the near-infrared
	- Added capability to use Adept's minimizers in optimize_lut.cpp,
	requiring Adept version >= 2.1

version 0.8 (June 2021)
	- Added copyright statements to source files
