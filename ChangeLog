version 1.5
	- Added hybrid-logarithmic-transmission-3 averaging method
	- optimize_lut exits with a non-zero error code if minimizer
	returns anomalous status (e.g. NaNs or dodgy bounds)
	- If absorption coefficient min=0 and max>0, then ensure minimizer
	bounds in log space are at least 1.0 apart

version 1.4 (November 2022)
	- Save solar spectral irradiance (corresponding to
	gpoint_fraction) in output file

version 1.3 (October 2022)
	- Added capability to create-LUT to use transmission averaging
	over 2, 3 and 10 layers instead of just 1.
	- Scripts use directories on ECMWF's Bologna HPC

version 1.2 (May 2022)
	- Added "fine" and "window" shortwave band structures for
	reference calculations including high resolution 290-340 nm for UV
	index calculations
	- create_look_up_table stores the min and max molar absorption
	coefficients, which can be used by optimize_lut to set hard bounds
	on the optimized coefficients and also to set the prior errors

version 1.1 (January 2022)
	- Made use of Adept L-BFGS minimizer the default
	- Removed lbfgs library

version 1.0 (January 2022)
	- Improved optimization of relative-linear representations (CH4
	and N2O), included optimization of CFC11
	- LW scripts produce models with g-point counts divisible by 4
	- Fixed bug in find_g_points shortwave where SSI was used
	without having been reordered
	- Introduced use of sub-bands for the near-infrared
	- Added capability to use Adept's minimizers in optimize_lut.cpp,
	requiring Adept version >= 2.1

version 0.8 (June 2021)
	- Added copyright statements to source files
